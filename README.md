### 🧠 AI Extension (Future Work)
This project will later include AI-based modules for:
- Predicting parking demand (ParkEasy)

### 🧠 Smart Parking Management Android Application  
Developed by **Nevil A. Godhani**, **Harsh J. Chopda**, and **Chintankumar M. Dobariya**  
Guided by **Prof. Vishwa Desai**

## 📘 Overview

**Park Easy** is a smart parking management system designed to simplify urban parking challenges by connecting **customers**, **parking owners**, **watchmen**, and **administrators** on a single mobile platform.  

The app enables users to **book parking slots online**, **track real-time availability**, and **manage payments securely** — reducing congestion and optimizing space utilization.  
This project was developed using **Java**, **XML**, and **Firebase** and serves as a strong example of data-driven and AI-ready system design.
